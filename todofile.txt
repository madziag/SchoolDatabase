12/3/2019: Contracts.php page. Middle of implementing sort on column. Need to make the buttons change the url - see example in contracts.php top of file


11/26/2019:
NOTE ON ADD PAYMENTS PAGE TO BE WORKED ON 10/29/2019

1. Total amount to be paid due should be dependent on the number of lessons given (lesson count in db)
3. Group vs Individual lessons 
5. Implement option that pinpoints which contract is being paid for (if previous contract has not be paid in full) -- if payment given, it should go to the oldest due bill)
7. At the moment we are working under assumption 1 contract per student. Need to adjust to see most recent contract (check if student can have more than 1 unsigned contracts)
8. consider error handling e.g. address code character limit 1103AM works 1103 AM does not
======================================================
1. Implement fuzzy matching
2. Prevent duplicate entries in DB --> done via search and retrieve -> tells you if student in DB or not. 
3. Adding new contract needs to be implemented
4. Safeguard against entering blank contract info -- user needs to enter loc, age, level -- check blank contract
<!--
- put in start date into insert statement
- Instead of 'New Contract Added, we can print Student Name, level, etc' after new contract added
-->

12/3/2019: 
Changes to be made: 
-> contract to be bound to school year and NOT semester - 
-> Nr of payments determined by number of months remaining in school year: paid in full = per semester
-> Amount due determined by number of lessons remaining in school year 
-> Does a student have old unpaid contracts?
-> contracts.php should show only current active contracts
-> make sort buttons work in contracts.php
-> contracts.php table -- if there is no record in the table payments then it is not loading the cash value amounts in table contracts
-> Interface to input amounts due and paid

12/10/2019: THESE QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH CONTRACTS.PHP
***  is it possible for a contract to start in Sept and shorter than 1 school year -- ask IZA 
*** if lessons cannot be done -> refund (possibly manually -- how often does this happen? Is it possible to do this by hand? --IZA
-- interface where she can manually adjust payment due 
*** can a student be enrolled in more than 1 class silmultaneously -- more than 1 active contract 
--- what is the actual total amount -- are books and starter pack included?

Notes from contracts.php
<!--
** Nice to haves -- in create contracts:
1. sql query with most recent contract from db
2. get location, level and age group info
3. select as default option that matches to those
4. Works like selecting the year

2/13/2019:
-- How are the dates for the classes stored? Google calendar? Can it be exported and linked to the php?
-- Possibility of creating a calendar where she can put in the dates and the dates can be stored in the form of an array
-- Create table in sql where each location age group and level gives a unique id
-- Possibility to manually enter new locations -- levels and age -groups should be the same.

Note for Next Week Feb 5:
Option in create contract: to find a way to predefine the number of lessons and startdate, and let user change them.

- we also need user to be able to enter contract (create contract)/payment info
-- calculate due date by month and amount due by the number of lessons.
- make sort buttons work in contracts
-- update button should allow user to update info.
-- insert same student by 2 different users/ 2 users trying to isert students at te same time
-- shared network drive/webserver -- /remote desktop

- search for students with payment due -- SearchRetrieve?
- Add contract/payment to new student?
- Edit payment info
- Case sensitivitiy in search

-- account for special characters when entering new data
-- automated email remainders -- contract & payment.
-- if student quits = user able to adjust amount owed...
-- be able to zero out months that student will no longer be attending but, in will still be able to show when student stillowes for the months they went

-- free text notes field -- contracts
-- need check box for new signed contract received

===== Questions =====
-- Link class level to new contract. When contract is updated, the class level should be updated as well -- option to manually adjust to different level.
-- is there a group level hierachy. Every level, different locations?
-- billing lower amounts e.g. 60 -- discount or partial payment?
-- set of possible payment schedules she stay to.
-- which classes have a book fee -- option to join with kalss
-- why some students have starter pack and others not?
-- do students change locations when they go up a level - relationship between groups and locations. how many locations do they have?
select klass and location together or separately? what does klas 3/2 mean?
-- contract.php table?
-- add notes column mysql -- archive old notes instead of delete??
-- individual students -- 2 students, 1 row (sylwia Majkut? who pays. Do students prepay or pay after the lessons. is there a contract?
