3/31/2020:

WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON: --> Make contract printable: Print button and Contract signed button, and return to search page with contract not signed.
Data to be printed is present but it is not pretty (ExecuteInsertContract.php)

-- Instead of hardcoding payment amounts in contracts.php, create a settings page through which the user is able to change the values herself. 

-- Get to contracts not signed, with signed button (contracts page - next to update link?)

1/7/2020:
Contracts
-- Main contract page should show only active contracts
-- Individual contract page should show all contracts, active and inactive (grey out?)/Does a student have old unpaid contracts? 
-- In create contract -> show all active contracts (for the current date or unpaid)
-- Get location, level and age group info => autofill with previous info (level up) for existing students
-- Check box for new signed contract received

Payments 
-- Enter Payments Area: Implement option that pinpoints which contract is being paid for (if previous contract has not be paid in full) -- 
   if payment given, it should go to the oldest due bill)
-- Nr of payments determined by number of months remaining in school year: paid in full = per semester
-- Amount due determined by number of months remaining in school year
-- If there is record in table payments, contract.php next due date shows as Paid which is incorrect 
-- Interface to input amounts due and paid
-- search for students with payment due -- contracts.php via sort buttons

Other
-- Group vs Individual lessons 
-- Implement fuzzy matching
-- Interface for entering new classes (locations, age groups, levels, class dates)
   Consider: 
	- How are the dates for the classes stored? Google calendar? Can it be exported and linked to the php?
	- Possibility of creating a calendar where she can put in the dates and the dates can be stored in the form of an array
-- Insert same student by 2 different users/ 2 users trying to isert students at te same time: shared network drive/webserver -- /remote desktop
-- automated email remainders -- contract & payment.
-- trim all input - consider other safety to prevent unwanted user entry input
-. Should we sort on any other columns in Contracts.php


===================================================================================================================================================
12/10/2019: THESE QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH CONTRACTS.PHP
***  is it possible for a contract to start in Sept and shorter than 1 school year -- ask IZA ===> yes, students can resign, have to give 1 month advance
Students pay one month in advance
*** if lessons cannot be done -> refund (possibly manually -- how often does this happen? Is it possible to do this by hand? --IZA => can be done manually
-- interface where she can manually adjust payment due 
*** can a student be enrolled in more than 1 class silmultaneously -- more than 1 active contract => yes -- individual and group -- rarely
--- what is the actual total amount -- are books and starter pack included? yes
	total = book= 50 + sp = 50
	1st rata incldes the sp /book/ 1st month = 196 (100 + 96) 96 => 6 lessons per month
	paidin full = 450 + 50 + 50
	maluchy = 50 zl per month, 1 x  week = 15 lessons per sem 16.66 zl per lesson/250 total/calosc 15.30 * 15 = 230
	adults = 17zl * 30 = 510 /calosc 16 * 30 (480)

-- Link class level to new contract. When contract is updated, the class level should be updated as well -- option to manually adjust to different level.
-- is there a group level hierachy. Every level, different locations?
-- billing lower amounts e.g. 60 -- discount or partial payment?
-- set of possible payment schedules she stay to.
-- which classes have a book fee -- option to join with kalss
-- why some students have starter pack and others not?
-- do students change locations when they go up a level - relationship between groups and locations. how many locations do they have?
select klass and location together or separately? what does klas 3/2 mean?
-- contract.php table?
-- add notes column mysql -- archive old notes instead of delete??
-- individual students -- 2 students, 1 row (sylwia Majkut? who pays. Do students prepay or pay after the lessons. is there a contract?
1. Guardians Name needs to be included
2. For groups, contract is from September 1 to June 30 -> sometimes groups will start in Feb --> umowa Feb 1 -> JUne 30
3. Individuals -> Umowa nieukreslona, payment z gory 4 or 8 lessons. 
4. Second semester changes every year. Every year the second semester starts in a different week (tury) -- there are 4 tury -- each wojewodstwo starts different tury 
1-2 nd start in January, 3-4 start in feb. 2020 - is 3rd, 2021 will be 4th 2022 - 1, 2023 -2. 1st semester always september - can we just write first and second semester instead
